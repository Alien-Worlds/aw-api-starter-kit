# API Starter Kit

This repository contains the basic structure for an API, along with all the necessary code to initialize and run it. It serves as a starting point for building APIs using Node.js, Typescript, Express and MongoDB.

## Dependencies

The API Starter Kit relies on the following dependencies:

- [@alien-worlds/api-core](https://github.com/Alien-Worlds/api-core): Core package providing common functionality for APIs.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [@alien-worlds/storage-mongodb](https://github.com/Alien-Worlds/storage-mongodb): MongoDB storage adapter for the API.

Additionally, it integrates with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) for application performance monitoring.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Alien-Worlds/api-starter-kit.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   yarn
   ```

3. Configure the API by setting up environment variables or editing the configuration files as needed.

4. Start the API:

   ```shell
   yarn start
   ```

## Endpoints

### Health Endpoint

- **URL:** `/health`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Retrieves information about the API's health, including statistics, database connection status, and dependency versions.

### Ping Endpoint

- **URL:** `/ping`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** A quick endpoint to check if the API is responding. It can be used for basic connectivity testing.

For more details on how to write your API using this starter kit, please refer to the [How to Write API](./tutorials/how-to-write-api.md) guide.
